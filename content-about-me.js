        <h1>A Snippet of My Story</h1>

        <div class="story-content">
            <p>My journey into problem-solving began early in my childhood. As an elementary school student, I developed a deep fascination for brain games and puzzles, especially through activities like LEGO building sets. Every Children's Day and birthday, I eagerly collected new LEGO sets, meticulously following instructions to construct intricate designs. What fascinated me most was not just assembling pieces, but the creative process of imagining and bringing something new to life. This early exposure to problem-solving ignited a passion for understanding systems and finding innovative solutions—an enthusiasm that would shape my future academic and entrepreneurial endeavors.</p>

            <p>High school marked a pivotal period of growth and exploration for me, particularly in terms of leadership and community engagement. I actively participated in various school committees and student organizations, where I learned invaluable lessons in teamwork, communication, and organizational management. Serving as a committee member in the student council allowed me to lead initiatives, organize events, and advocate for student interests. These experiences not only honed my leadership skills but also sparked a deep-seated interest in creating positive change within my community. They laid the groundwork for my future aspirations in organizational leadership and community building.</p>

            <p>My academic journey expanded significantly when I was awarded a scholarship to participate in the Spring Exchange Program at <a href="https://www.ajou.ac.kr/en/index.do" class="hover-link">Ajou University</a> in South Korea. From February to June 2024, I immersed myself in courses at the College of Business Administration, focusing on E-Business with specialized studies in Technology Development & Society (Artificial Intelligence) and Cross-cultural Management. This experience broadened my understanding of global business practices and technological advancements, while actively participating in the Rust development community workshop in Seoul enriched my practical skills and cross-cultural insights. This exchange program not only enhanced my academic prowess but also fueled my passion for global innovation and collaboration.</p>

            <p>Upon returning from Ajou University, I co-founded Learnitab, an innovative EdTech platform dedicated to empowering Indonesian university students. Recognizing the critical need for accessible opportunities and effective academic tools, we developed a centralized digital dashboard offering pro-bono career preparation resources, expert mentoring, and personalized productivity tools. Research showed that 80% of college students struggle academically, with 58% experiencing burnout. Learnitab addresses these challenges by integrating AI tools like Notion and ChatGPT to enhance student learning experiences and foster personal development.</p>

            <p>At <a href="https://www.unpad.ac.id/" class="hover-link">Universitas Padjadjaran</a>, my commitment to community and innovation flourished. As the Digital Transformation Strategy Manager at StudentsCatalyst and founder of CollegeCopilot, I led initiatives that grew these platforms to over 10,000 members. Organizing impactful events and fostering AI education were central to my role, allowing me to apply leadership skills in real-world contexts. These experiences earned me recognition as a <a href="https://yli.or.id" class="hover-link">Young Leader for Indonesia</a>, known for expertise in digital community building and AI innovation. They underscored my passion for leveraging technology to drive social impact and highlighted the importance of creating collaborative, innovative environments for future generations.</p>

            <p>My journey has been defined by a relentless pursuit of excellence and a commitment to continuous learning and growth. Participating in national and international business case competitions has reinforced my strategic thinking, leadership capabilities, and data-driven decision-making skills. Notable achievements include:</p>
